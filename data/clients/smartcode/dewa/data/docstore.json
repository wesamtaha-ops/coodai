Hence, in case of power failure in \none of the feeders, the other feeder should be capable to meet whole demand for maximum 6 \nhours duration.\nDEWA standard 11 kV cable sizes are 3/C 300mm2 Copper XLPE, 3/C 240mm2 Copper XLPE, and \n3/C 240mm2 Aluminum XLPE.\nThe maximum sustained load of 11kV feeder is 175A/3MW (for 300mm2 Copper XLPE cables – \nsummer rating).","metadata":{"source":"/Users/wesam_t/Desktop/langchain/coodai/data/clients/smartcode/dewa/original/dewa-regulations-for-electrical-installations-2017-edition.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"","Creator":"Adobe Illustrator CS6 (Windows)","Producer":"Adobe PDF library 10.01","CreationDate":"D:20170205095549+04'00'","ModDate":"D:20170516123549+04'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xap:modifydate":"2017-05-16T12:35:49+04:00","xap:createdate":"2017-02-05T09:55:49+04:00","xap:metadatadate":"2017-05-16T12:35:49+04:00","xap:creatortool":"Adobe Illustrator CS6 (Windows)","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"","xapmm:documentid":"uuid:0fc1a238-35fc-41c0-8aef-f56c328e1ce5","xapmm:instanceid":"uuid:6ae35148-5376-474e-baf4-ba4645628e9b","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF library 10.01"}},"totalPages":135},"loc":{"pageNumber":73,"lines":{"from":1,"to":37}}}}],["220",{"pageContent":"3/C 240mm2 Aluminum XLPE.\nThe maximum sustained load of 11kV feeder is 175A/3MW (for 300mm2 Copper XLPE cables – \nsummer rating).\nThe maximum sustained load of 11kV feeder is 160A/2.7MW (for 240mm2 Copper XLPE cables \n– summer rating).\nFor   bulk   loads   such   as   furnaces   or   district   cooling   requiring   direct   HV   supply   (private   \nequipment's),  space  for  metering  units  at  client’s  premises/substation  shall  be  considered.  \nNecessary documents, drawings and SLD shall be submitted for comments/approval at design \nstage.\nSingle unit load demand shall not exceed the maximum sustained current of MV cable/feeder, \nwhich is maximum 175A/3MW for 11kV feeder.\nParallel operation of DEWA’s MV feeders are not allowed at any circumstances, and accordingly \nproper interlocking (Electrical & Mechanical) shall be provided where required.\nStandby  generators  are  not  allowed  to  operate  in  parallel  with  DEWA’s  network.
